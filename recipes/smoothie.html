               Description
        </h2>
        Add a kiwi, an apple, a fresh banana, juice or milk, you can even 
        add some water if you don't have juice or milk. Optionally, 
        if you your grocery store has strawberries and if you can afford it,
        you can add some to make it less green and more red.
        Prawctically, you can add any fruit that you like or
        a vegetable that you like or that you don't even like 
        but it is healthy. E.g. a broccoli is the the tasties thin on 
        earth, but while drinking this smoothie you won't even notice
        the taste of the broccoli. You can add some other veggies, like
        carrot or a boiled pumpkin to boost your immune. 
        Personally I just add all the veggies that are in my fridge,
        and I don't even choose them by their flavor but rather
        by their color. But I really don't like adding a beetroot 
        into my smoothie, it makes the smoothie purple and the beetroot's 
        flavor supresses tha flovor of other tasty fruits. Do far 
        only a beetroot can supress the flavor of other tasty fruits,
        but you can add a beetrootif you like it's taste. So, 
        suit yourself!</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ou>
            <li>kiwi</li>
            <li>banana</li>
            <li>apple</li>
            <li>milk or juice, or water</li>
            <li>broccoli</li>
            <li>cabbages</li>
            <li>cauliflower(after all, why not?)</li>
            <li>lettuce</li>
            <li>pineapple</li>
            <li>basically any fruit or vegetable that you can come up with, and most
                importantly, that you have in your fridge or that grows in you garden,
                or that has a grocery store around the corner
            </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>add a banana, cause a banana is crucial to any smoothie and it
                supresses undesired flovor of other veggies that you don't like but are beneficial
                to your health
            </li>
            <li>add an apple, cause it's cheap and tasty</li>
            <li>then add fruits and veggies as much as you want, and most importantly, 
                as mush as your smooothiemaker can contain. Ideally, fill in your
                smoothiemaker until it is halfway full. Unless you want to make a pouree
                and not a smoothie. 
            </li>
            <li>That's it, your soothie is ready!</li>
